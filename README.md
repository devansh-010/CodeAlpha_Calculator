# CodeAlpha_Calculator
Calculator Web App built during my internship at CodeAlpha. This project demonstrates the practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional calculator with a clean UI and responsive design. It helped strengthen my fundamentals of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic logic building.
